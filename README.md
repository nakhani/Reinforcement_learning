## Introduction

This repository is a collection of homework assignments focused on basic reinforcement learning algorithms. It provides a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing foundational concepts in reinforcement learning. Each folder contains a specific project, complete with implementations and explanations.

## Folders

### 10-Armbandit Algorithm

This folder contains the implementation of a 10-armed bandit problem. It explores the basic concepts of action selection and reward optimization in a multi-armed bandit scenario.

### Gambler's Method

This folder includes the Gambler's method implemented in two versions: a simple approach and an optimal policy approach. The method demonstrates the use of policy iteration to determine the optimal strategy for a gambler trying to reach a target sum.

### Grid World 16

This folder contains the implementation of a 4x4 Grid World. It is a simple reinforcement learning environment where an agent navigates through a grid to reach a goal state.

### Grid World 25

This folder includes a more complex 5x5 Grid World environment. It is implemented in two versions: a simple version and an optimal policy version, demonstrating the application of reinforcement learning techniques to larger state spaces.
